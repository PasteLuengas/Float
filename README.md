  <h1>Float</h1>

Float is a Python-HTML App to Download, video, audio, and playlists from Youtube. This is actually useless while there are things like <a href="https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl">youtube-dl</a>.

But well, I just did it to learn <a href="https://github.com/python-eel/Eel">Eel</a>.

<h2>Features:</h2>
👍 Fast And Easy to use <br>
🤓 You can run it in your browser with <code>Localhost</code> <br>
😶 Though this was made in Eel, It needs Tkinter (yeah, that's extremly stupid) <br>
